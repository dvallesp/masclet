MASCLET framework

Provides several functions to read MASCLET outputs and perform basic operations.
Also, serves as a bridge between MASCLET data and the yt package (v 3.5.1).

masclet4yt module
Aims to serve as a user-friendly link between masclet software and the yt
package

    This function creates a list of dictionaries containing the information requiered for yt's load_amr_grids

        path: path of the grids file in the system (str)
        digits: number of digits the filename is written with (int)

        right_edge, level and dimensions [number of cells])
